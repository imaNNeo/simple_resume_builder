  "summary": "I have been working as a Software Engineer for 10 years, focusing mainly on Mobile Application Development for the last 9 years. My experience with Flutter development started 5 years ago, and since then, I have been actively contributing to the Flutter community. One of my significant contributions is the creation of the 'fl_chart' package, which has gained more than 6k stars on GitHub. I also run flutter4fun.com, a blog where I post solutions and tutorials for UI/UX challenges in Flutter.\nIn addition to these, I have been involved in various side projects using Flutter for the past 4 years. These projects range from game development to security topics like End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). My background in Android Development includes using Kotlin and Java for projects in sectors such as Maps and Navigation, Social Media, Shopping, Fin-Tech, and E-commerce.",
